inputs:
 - folder
 - file (*.txt)

outputs (files only):
 - outline.tif
 - overlayed.tif
 - Parameters.txt
 - segmented.png
 - $name.csv

Technical Debt Improvements:
 - overall interface
   - maybe turn main into a script, and work from there, easier to follow
 - input handling
   - what do the inputs even mean?
 - use builtins where possible
   - file handling
   - what does each function do?
 - remove dead code
 - improve/trim comments
 - style consistency
 - refactoring
 - why RNG? remove and replace with deterministic strategy if possible

Feature Improvements:
 - batch mode
   - automatically loop over all images in folder
   - automatically generate useful aggregate outputs
